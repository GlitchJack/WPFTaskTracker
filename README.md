# WPFTaskTracker
 Task Tracker that allows user freedom of format while giving just enough features to function well.
 
 Users can create new tasks that are tracked using built-in SQLite database, view a preview of their tasks from the task list, edit their tasks after creation right
 from preview, and even set if task has been completed or delete the task at any point.
